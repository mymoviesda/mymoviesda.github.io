Had Abhishek Bachchan not been under pressure to become a superstar, he would not have known when he would have established himself as a good actor. When Bachchan was added to the name, everyone saw him as a superstar and not an artist. Those actors are good provided the director knows the limits of their acting.<ins class="hb6d4c9baf5" data-affquery="/81dee8bcaf/b6d4c9baf5/?placementName=default" data-domain="//aaaaaco.com" data-height="0" data-width="0"></ins>

He does a great job in drama films. Films such as ‘Guru’, ‘Yuva’, ‘Bunty Aur Babli’, ‘Sarkar’, ‘Dhoom’ and ‘Manmargiyaan’ draw a graph of his acting in which he attempts to advance himself as an actor. Looks like. There are many flop films in between these films, but in his second innings, Abhishek has started to look like a better actor. ‘The Big Bull’ is another hallmark of this.

The film ‘The Big Bull’ is not a spice film. It is a straight-line&nbsp;Flim, which has been adopted by its director Kuki Gulati in today’s time to tell the story through a journalist. For Kuki, this is the turning point of his career and he made a film with a lot of effort.

The film could have been much better if a little more work was done in the screenplay. Also, the casting of the film was also done with a little patience.

Inspired by the Harshad Mehta chapter, ‘The Big Bull’ is about a middle class family.&nbsp;Some people in this class do not believe in the Nine to Five job.&nbsp;This is about people who want to be entrepreneurs.&nbsp;No one wants to do a job, but wants to give a job.

Harshad Mehta tried to do all this 30 years ago.&nbsp;Today, the government appeals to the unemployed youth to become job seekers.

&nbsp;also hints at another point that the biggest strength is not money or power.&nbsp;The center of power is in information.&nbsp;The one who has the meaning or the inside of the political world is omnipotent.&nbsp;The film also raises questions about the government.

‘The Big Bull’ is based on the 90’s.&nbsp;At that time, the Indian economy was about to undergo a major transformation.&nbsp;How Hemant Shah, the hero who lived in Chali at that time, became Amitabh Bachchan of the stock market by taking advantage of the loophole of the then banking system.&nbsp;The interesting thing about the film is that the role of the king of this stock market is being played by Abhishek Bachchan, the son of Big B.

We have seen in Abhishek Bachchan’s grip on the characters in ‘Guru’.&nbsp;Here Hemant Shah’s thoughts, decisions, restlessness, ambitions are presented very well.&nbsp;In ‘Guru’, Abhishek in Gurukant Desai was aggressive and loud.&nbsp;Here Hemant Shah is calm and restrained.&nbsp;Hemant’s brother Viren is played by Soham Shah.&nbsp;He has created a different image from his gestures.&nbsp;Saurabh Shukla is in the role of Hemant’s opponent Mannubhai.

Saurabh has failed to make an impact like ‘Jolly LLB’ judge Tripathi.&nbsp;Looks like he’s downplay with the character.&nbsp;Journalist Mira Rao i.e. Ileana D’Cruz, Nikita Dutta in the role of Hemant’s wife and other actors are also weak.&nbsp;The lyrics are as good as the situation.

Director Cookie Gulati co-wrote the story of the film with Patkath Arjun Dhawan.&nbsp;The dialogues are written by Riteish Shah.&nbsp;Cookie, Arjun and Riteish have also raised questions against the government.

The system does not allow the middle class to get rich in a short cut, but politicians and businessmen have been making money this way for years.

Cookie, Arjun and Riteish ask three questions, is it a crime to adopt a middle class short cut and succeed in it?&nbsp;Why are there loopholes where even the bubble seems to have economic power?&nbsp;‘The Big Bull’ is an attempt to look inside the system and society and find answers to such questions.
