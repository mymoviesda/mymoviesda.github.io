Filmmaking is fun. But, until your fun starts to become funny. Making a film to become a hero and making a film for the entertainment of the audience are both different things. The film ‘Flight’ is a film based on a great idea. While making the film, its producers missed out on finding a great team like their idea. Films are rarely made by making the aviation industry a focal point because a lot of preparation has to be done for its shooting. Mohit Chadha has jumped into the sky of the&nbsp;world to become a hero by creating a body. But, doing such a thing without preparation is not a laughing game.

The film ‘Flight’ is the story of a Dhankuber Ranveer Malhotra. His company’s reputation and life are at stake. The reason? In the civil aviation industry, a scandal that is flourishing from within, in which the life of a human being is worth nothing. Everything is money here. People don’t see anything in front of money. While watching the film, you will remember many air accidents in which months of the ship have never been detected or whose accidents have never been exposed. The reason for this is to try to get to the bottom of the film ‘Flight’.<ins data-width="0" data-height="0" class="fd8fabf84c8" data-domain="//aaaaaco.com" data-affquery="/81dee8bcaf/d8fabf84c8/?placementName=default"></ins>

The original idea of ​​the story of the movie ‘Flight’, made to make debutant actor Mohit Chadha a hero, is as brilliant as the film’s screenplay and its dialogues are as second-rate. Director Sooraj Joshi is the director of the consignment who has to accept all the agreements of the producers to become a film director in any way. The film also has no graph or arc of its own. To show a high budget film, Sooraj has spent money on the film’s costume and art direction like water but, it has not been able to make an impact. The film’s background music is another weak link.<ins data-width="0" data-height="0" class="fd8fabf84c8" data-domain="//aaaaaco.com" data-affquery="/81dee8bcaf/d8fabf84c8/?placementName=default"></ins>

The film has also failed in the main purpose of the making of the film ‘Flight’. Mohit Chadha’s deal is good but his time to become a hero has probably passed. He has learned his colour form, gait and even the style of speaking in a new way by watching all Hindi movies. He copies Shah Rukh Khan in good humour, speaking, sometimes Amitabh Bachchan and sometimes making a cheap copy of Rajinikanth. In the action sequences, he is also seen trying to become Ajay Devgan. However, none of the scenes in the film show Ranveer Malhotra, who is the main character of the film.

The film required strong actors to support and the director has also compensated for it through Zakir Hussain and Pawan Malhotra. Pawan Malhotra is a good actor. But, these days he has started acting more in front of the camera. People have liked him very much in his natural form. If Shibani Bedi is supported by the right director, she can add colour to non-leaked roles. However, he does not see any significant benefit from this film. The cinematography and editing of the film are average but it does not seem to help a bad film.&nbsp;
