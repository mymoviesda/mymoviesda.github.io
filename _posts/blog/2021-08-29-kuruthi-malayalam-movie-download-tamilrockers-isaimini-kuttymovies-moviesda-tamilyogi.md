**_[kuruthi Malayalam movie](https://techsambavangal.in/kuruthi-malayalam-movie-2021/) story review and update?_**

Hatred, man always needs something to hate, and there will always be one between us and them to maintain that hatred. One grain of hatred is enough, and it will burn like a fire. Once burned, we will continue to hate that fire will not go out ” – says an old man named Moosa Qadar, a great universal truth.

What has changed from the man who lived by hunting and fighting in caves and later evolved into different tribes and beliefs, from the man who built religions to the modern man of today? This may be the reason why tribalism and religious consciousness continue to haunt this human race. Why would he take up arms in the guise of faith to kill his comrades? Why would he insist that his only right is right? Kuruthi is a film that leaves the audience to the logic of asking the answer without asking a lot of questions. Beyond being a thriller, Kuruti talks about some of the issues that still plague human beings today.

On one side is a family consisting of Ibrahim (Roshan Mathew) who lost his wife and only daughter in the landslide, and his father Moosa Khader (Mamukoya) and brother Rasool. Preman (Manikandan Acharya) who lost his wife in the same tragedy and his sister Zuma on the other side (Shrinda). The two families were left stranded when everyone fled the jungle in the aftermath of the landslide. While they are living with mutual love and respect, a policeman comes to Moosa Qadir’s house one night with the accused. Zuma arrives with food for Ibrahim and his family. The theme of the film is taken to another level with the arrival of Ibru’s friend Kareem and his friend Laikh. It is the struggle of human beings who have to fall victim to the conflict between primitive human beings that leads to hatred and a sense of identity. The audience will not be able to take sides if they stand with those helpless men.

Aneesh Palliyal, the screenwriter who narrated the story without changing a single mustard seed, is a very commendable subject that people in our society approach very emotionally. At the same time, director Manu Warrier has done full justice to the script by making the audience on the verge of conflict. Abhinandan Ramanujan, the cinematographer, and Jake Bijoe, the music director, added to the theme of the film.

While Roshan Mathew, Srinda Prithviraj Sukumaran, Murali Gopi, Shine, Tom Choco, Naslin and Sagar Surya did justice to their roles, Mammootty’s performance is noteworthy. Moosa is a very different character from the roles Mammootty has played in Malayalam cinema for decades. Mamukakoya was playing the role of a man who thinks only from the side of human beings who have a lot of life experiences.

When evaluating contemporary events, rational-minded people will understand how dangerous tribalism is, which is holding back modern man. Let Kuruthi start new discussions in our society which is ruled by communalism, religious consciousness and casteism. Let the over-readings and postmortems of the movies be for good thoughts.
