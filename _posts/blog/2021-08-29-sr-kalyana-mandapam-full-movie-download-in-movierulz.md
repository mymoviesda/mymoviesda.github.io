Kiran Abbavaram, the young and talented hero who introduced himself to the Telugu industry with the film ‘Rajavaru Ranigaru’, impressed the audience and the critics with his first movie. Now this young hero has come up with a different title for ‘SR Kalyanamandapam’. Saikumar played a pivotal role in the film, which was directed by Sridhar Gade.

Dharma (Sai ​​Kumar) from Kadapa district is a drunkard. Failing to maintain the Srirajya Lakshmi Kalyana Mandapam (SR Kalyana Mandapam) inherited from his father, he becomes addicted to alcohol. His son Kalyan (Kiran Abbavaram) is studying engineering in the city. Paparao (Srikanth Iyengar) falls in love with Sindhu (Prayanka Jawalkar), a girl from his village who is studying in the same college. Kalyan who does not want to talk to his father .. Nana sings to get Indus love. One day when the phone rang from home, Kalyan went to his village.

For some reason the name was erased and the demand decreased. R. Kalyanamandapam will shoulder the management responsibilities. Kalyan studying engineering ‌ .. Why did he try to lead the welfare mandapa? SR, which has a long history. Did it bring pre-glory to the wedding hall? Why did Kalyan not talk to his father? How did Kalyan get the Indus love that he did not like? That’s the rest of the story.

Kiran Abbavaram played the role of Kalyan, an engineering student. He did well in dance as well as fights. Kiran also acted wonderfully in some emotional scenes. Priyanka Jawalkar impresses in the role of Sindhu. It looked so beautiful on screen. Saikumar‌ played the father of the hero wonderfully. The drunken character transcended. Most importantly, quarrels with the wife and quarrels look very natural. Srikanth Iyengar along with other actresses and actors played the role of Paparao with negative shades within the scope of their roles.

The whole story of the movie is in line with the title. R. Kalyana mandapam revolves around. It is the story of a grandson who finds himself incapable of fulfilling his grandfather’s wish, to an incompetent son who does not properly maintain the marriage hall inherited from his father. Director Sridhar Gade tried to impress the youth by adding love to it. Though there is plenty of sentiment‌ it must be said that the director failed to cultivate it on screen. It would have been nice if the father had elevated the strong emotions between the sons even better.

Also, it would have been nice if the script had been written a little stronger. S.R.R., who has a very great name. They could not show a strong reason why bookings were not coming to the wedding hall. Once the name was written in the marriage mandapam register, the sentiment that the wedding was going to take place anyway did not bear much fruit. There is nothing new in the story either. Sentiment‌ scenes‌ workout‌ but the level of the movie was different. The fact that the length of the film is too long is a bit of a negative.

Although some of the scenes in the second half are boring, the emotional scenes between father and son in the climax are a bit of a workout. The main strength of this film is the music of Chaitanya Bhardwaj. Raised the level of the film by giving a catchy background‌ score along with catchy songs. He enlivened some scenes with his own BGM. Focus on editing. In many places, especially in the second half, the editor had to tell his scissors to work. Vishwas Daniel Cinematography This film is very naturally good to adapt to Nativity. The production values ​​are in line with the cinematic level.
