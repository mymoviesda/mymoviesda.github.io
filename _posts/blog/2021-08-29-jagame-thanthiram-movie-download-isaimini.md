        Shashikant: I don’t think it’s really a debate. For now, it is more in terms of what is possible, as the industry is in survival mode. Perhaps later, there will be a discussion on how theater and platform can coexist. But at present, filmmakers and producers together need to understand that circumstances are the exception to the rule, and we need to see that.

        As a manufacturer, I have to think about what is the best way to get my product to as many people as possible, right? I have a high quality product, and Netflix is ​​a great fit for it. So I’m not looking at the negatives of a non-theatrical release, and am instead focusing on the fact that world-class domestic content is reaching the same audiences who are watching Narcos or House of Cards. Jagme.. is a quality production from Tamil cinema to the rest of the world. So I’m very excited on that front.
