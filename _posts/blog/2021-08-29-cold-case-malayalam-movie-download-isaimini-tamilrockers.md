We are hopeful that the story and the film as a whole will be liked and discussed by the people,” Prithviraj said during the session.</span>

Prithviraj also said that he didn’t have to be too convincing to take on Cold Case, which combines elements of the crime and horror genres. “When I heard the story, it was an immediate yes for me because it was a hybrid genre film that was written really well. Also, it has been a great learning experience for me.”

One of the most awaited films of Prithviraj Sukumaran and Aditi Balan- Cold Case is all set to release on Amazon Prime Video in just two days. Directed by cinematographer-turned-director&nbsp;<span>Tanu</span>&nbsp;<span>Balak</span>, the film revolves around a murder investigation that has a close association with supernatural elements and dark forces.

Featuring a promising cast including&nbsp;<span>Suchitra Pillai</span>,&nbsp;<span>Lakshmi Priya Chandramouli</span>, Eleanor and late actor Anil Nedumangad, the film certainly has its own novelty, be it the concept, the story or the inclusion of some really talented actors, especially From Aditi Balan, who made her Malayalam debut with Thriller. It is to be noted that Cold Case is the actress’ first Malayalam film to be released, however, the star’s first Malayalam film to be shot is Nivin Poly-starrer Padavettu, which is yet to release.

Aditi is best known for her debut Tamil film Aruvi (2017), which paved her way to superstardom. However, the young promising actress was seen taking a long hiatus of three years and making a comeback in 2021 with the Tamil anthology film Kutty Story which also received a lot of love from the audience. Well now, Aditi Balan is eagerly awaiting the release of her next film, she shared her thoughts about her film journey, Cold Case and expectations from Amazon Prime release during an exclusive conversation with Filmibeat.

Basically, I am very new to the industry. Aruvi was my first film and then it hit a place where it was a lot of responsibility and pressure for me. So for three years I was understanding that you do not need to take so much tension. Basically for me to figure out that’s okay, I can do different roles. So it was a conscious effort not to repeat such roles. I didn’t want it to be the same stereotype character.
