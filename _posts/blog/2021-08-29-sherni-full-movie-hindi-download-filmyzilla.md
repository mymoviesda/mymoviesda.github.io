The deep, dark forest can be romanticized and turned into a battlefield for the heroic tale of a savior pitted against multiple stakeholders who threaten to shake the balance of the fragile ecosystem. Or it can be viewed through a realistic lens that appears deceptively simple, like director Amit Masurkar does in Sherni.</span>

<span face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">The title refers to a man-eating tigress on the hunt and also refers to Divisional Forest Officer Vidya Vincent (Vidya Balan). She isn’t the perfect screen heroine who ventures out of muddy waters, but is understated and determined to navigate the mundane of her government job in order to assert herself.</span>

  <p>
      In Newton (2017), Masurkar shows his subtle understanding of the social fabric through the efforts of an electoral official to facilitate elections in a disturbed region. There, the game between hope and reality unfolds as a black comedy. He describes the lioness as an insider who knows the workings of the administration very well. Even some of the comic moments stemmed from an insider’s point of view.
    </p>

  
  
  <p>
      The lioness is also part of the forestry process – the striking opening scene of an officer crawling and mimicking a tiger, to test whether hidden cameras can capture the footage, and later to collect DNA samples from victims’ bodies. Work when anger is high.
    </p>

  
  
  <p>
      At no point does Masurkar reveal the proceedings dramatically. If Vidya emerges victorious in her stay in the middle of Tigress T12’s journey back to the deep forest, it doesn’t go along the expected lines. Instead, a story that seems completely true leaves us wondering how success is measured. Should one win the battle with the big stake or be content with making small changes? Does anyone really care?
    </p>

  
  
  <p>
      The restrained nature of the protagonist and the narrative makes the story formidable. The music of Bandish Project is also noteworthy, along with cinematography by Rakesh Haridas and subtle, effective background scores by Benedict Taylor and Naren Chandavarkar.

  <p>
      The lioness’s triumph also stems from its actors. Vidya is a master of her parts and takes it easy to portray her inner self. His character is also a lesson in screenwriting – combating patriarchy with a quiet resilience. Masurkar also explores her relationship with her family, where she asserts herself with mutual respect.
    </p>

  
  
  <p>
      Vijay Raaz is natural and remarkable in his part, knowing he is a vital cog in the big wheel. Sharat Saxena, Neeraj Kabi, Ila Arun and the actors and villagers who form political factions all fit in seamlessly. Brijendra Kala gets some funny moments when he reenacts the poems to an unrivaled audience.
