Now mollywood comes on the list with the movie Aanum Pennum. It is one of the anthology films that has three different stories directed by Aashiq Abu, Venu Isc and Jay K. As the title of the film, it portrays the equal participation of women and men in their lives.

The story begins with Savithri’s (Samyuktha Menon) directed by Jay K, a Communist-run during the British Raj in the mid-20th century, finds refugee. Next Venu’s plot Ranchiyamma (Parvathy Thiruvothu), the story revolves around the relationship between the milkmaid and the plantation officer in charge of the estate. The last plot of Aashiq Abu, Rani (Darshana Rajendran), this story is about the untapped talent of youngsters exposing them and getting better.

Story on perception, dishonesty and want. There is a plethora of stories about male-female associations showing the not so discreet that the man can have, while the woman has the brain. There are three stories in the arrangement of Savitri, Rachiyamma and Rani. Savitri is composed by Jay K, and the story is set in the time immediately after the British Raj in Kerala, when the Communists were directly cast into doubt. Savitri, a friend on the run, tells of two young and energetic loved ones whose enthusiasm improves. It is a reminder of a time when a woman’s morality was in her atonement, and when her sincere commitment to a man was appreciated.
